## Coding Conventions

This project follows the philosophy described in [PEP 8][pep-ref], which
is summarized in the quote below.

> ## A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds[^pep-quote]
>
> [^pep-quote]: [PEP 8: A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds][pep-ref-ch2]
>
> One of Guido’s key insights is that code is read much more often than it is
> written. The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability
> of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code. As
> PEP 20 says, “Readability counts”.
>
> A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is
> important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency
> within one module or function is the most important.
>
> However, know when to be inconsistent – sometimes style guide recommendations
> just aren’t applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other
> examples and decide what looks best. And don’t hesitate to ask!
>
> In particular: do not break backwards compatibility just to comply with this
> PEP!
>
> Some other good reasons to ignore a particular guideline:
>
> 1. When applying the guideline would make the code less readable, even for
>    someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP.
> 2. To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe for
>    historic reasons) – although this is also an opportunity to clean up
>    someone else’s mess (in true XP style).
> 3. Because the code in question predates the introduction of the guideline
>    and there is no other reason to be modifying that code.
> 4. When the code needs to remain compatible with older versions of Python
>    that don’t support the feature recommended by the style guide.
